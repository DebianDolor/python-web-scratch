# Basic feature

* HTTP is connectionless: 
    - The HTTP client initiates an HTTP request and after a request is made, the client disconnects from the server and waits for a response. The server process the request and re-establish the connection with the client to send response back.

* HTTP is media independent: 
    - This means, any type of data can be sent by HTTP as long as both the client and server know how to handle the data content. This is required for client as well as server to specify the content type using appropriate MIME-type.

* HTTP is stateless: 
    - As mentioned above, HTTP is a connectionless and this is a direct result that HTTP is a stateless protocol. The server and client are aware of each other only during a current request. Afterwards, both of them forget about each other. Due to this nature of the protocol, neither the client nor the browser can retain information between different request across the web pages.

# HTTP Request

* An HTTP client sends an HTTP request to a server in the form of a request message which includes following format:
        - A Request-line
        - Zero or more header (General|Request|Entity) fields followed by CRLF
        - An empty line indicating the end of the header fields
        - Optionally a message-body

* Message Request-Line:
    - Begins with a method token, followed by the Request-URI and the protocol version, and ending with CRLF. The elements are separated by space SP characters.
    ```
    Request-Line   = Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF
    ```

* Request Method:
    -	`GET`: The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.
    -	`HEAD`: Same as GET, but only transfer the status line and header section.
    -	`POST`: A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example customer information, file upload etc using HTML forms.
    -	`PUT`: Replace all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.
    -   `DELETE`: Remove all current representations of the target resource given by URI.
    -   `CONNECT`: Establish a tunnel to the server identified by a given URI.
    -   `OPTIONS`: Describe the communication options for the target resource.
    -	`TRACE`: Perform a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.

* Query string:

    - A query string is a part of a URL that assigns values to specified parameters.
    - A web server can handle a HTTP request either by reading a file from its file system based on the URL path or by handling the request using logic that is specific to the type of resource. In cases where special logic is invoked, the query string will be available to that logic for use in its processing, along with the path component of the URL. 
    - Example: (? is the query string)
    ```
    GET /genapp/customers?name=Joe%20Bloggs/?
    Host: www.example.com
    ``` 
* Request header fields:
    - The request-header fields allow the client to pass additional information about the request, and about the client itself, to the server.
    - and about the client itself, to the server. These fields act as request modifiers and there are following important Request-header fields available which can be used based on requirement:
        - Accept-Charset
        - Accept-Encoding
        - Accept-Language
        - Authorization
        - Expect
        - From
        - Host
        - If-Match
        - If-Modified-Since
        - If-None-Match
        - If-Range
        - If-Unmodified-Since
        - Max-Forwards
        - Proxy-Authorization
        - Range
        - Referer
        - TE
        - User-Agent

* Example:
```
GET /hello.htm HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive
```

# HTTP Response

* After receiving and interpreting a request message, a server responds with an HTTP response message:
    - A Status-line
    - Zero or more header (General|Response|Entity) fields followed by CRLF
    - An empty line indicating the end of the header fields
    - Optionally a message-body

* Message Status-Line:
    - The Status-Line consisting of the protocol version followed by a numeric status code and its associated textual phrase. The elements are separated by space SP characters.
    ```
    Status-Line = HTTP-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF
    ```

* HTTP Version:
    - A server supporting HTTP version 1.1 will return following version information:
    ```
    HTTP-Version = HTTP/1.1
    ```

* Status code:
    - The Status-Code element is a 3-digit integer where first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response and the last two digits do not have any categorization role:
        - `1xx - Informational`: This means request received and continuing process.
        - `2xx - Success`: This means the action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
        - `3xx - Redirection`: This means further action must be taken in order to complete the request.
        - `4xx - Client Error`: This means the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
        - `5xx - Server Error`: The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request


* Response Header Fields:
    - The response-header fields allow the server to pass additional information about the response which cannot be placed in the Status- Line.
    - These header fields give information about the server and about further access to the resource identified by the Request-URI:
        - Accept-Ranges
        - Age
        - ETag
        - Location
        - Proxy-Authenticate
        - Retry-After
        - Server
        - Vary
        - WWW-Authenticate

* Body:
    - Not all responses have a body: responses with a status code that sufficiently answers the request without the need for corresponding payload (like 201 Created or 204 No Content) usually don't.
    - Bodies can be broadly divided into three categories:
        - Single-resource bodies, consisting of a single file of known length, defined by the two headers: `Content-Type` and `Content-Length`.
        - Single-resource bodies, consisting of a single file of unknown length, encoded by chunks with `Transfer-Encoding` set to `chunked`.
        - Multiple-resource bodies, consisting of a multipart body, each containing a different section of information. These are relatively rare.

* Example (of the above request):
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Last-Modified: Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:15:56 GMT
Content-Length: 88
Content-Type: text/html
Connection: Closed

<html>
<body>
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
