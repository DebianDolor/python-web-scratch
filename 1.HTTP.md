# Basic feature

* HTTP is connectionless: 
    - The HTTP client initiates an HTTP request and after a request is made, the client disconnects from the server and waits for a response. The server process the request and re-establish the connection with the client to send response back.

* HTTP is media independent: 
    - This means, any type of data can be sent by HTTP as long as both the client and server know how to handle the data content. This is required for client as well as server to specify the content type using appropriate MIME-type.

* HTTP is stateless: 
    - As mentioned above, HTTP is a connectionless and this is a direct result that HTTP is a stateless protocol. The server and client are aware of each other only during a current request. Afterwards, both of them forget about each other. Due to this nature of the protocol, neither the client nor the browser can retain information between different request across the web pages.

# HTTP Request

* Format:
    - An HTTP client sends an HTTP request to a server in the form of a request message which includes following format:
        - A Request-line
        - Zero or more header (General|Request|Entity) fields followed by CRLF
        - An empty line indicating the end of the header fields
        - Optionally a message-body

* Request Method:
    -	`GET`: The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.
    -	`HEAD`: Same as GET, but only transfer the status line and header section.
    -	`POST`: A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example customer information, file upload etc using HTML forms.
    -	`PUT`: Replace all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.
    -   `DELETE`: Remove all current representations of the target resource given by URI.
    -   `CONNECT`: Establish a tunnel to the server identified by a given URI.
    -   `OPTIONS`: Describe the communication options for the target resource.
    -	`TRACE`: Perform a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
